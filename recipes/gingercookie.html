        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup molasses</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set aside 2 tablespoons sugar in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Sift together flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Cream margarine and remaining 1 cup sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy.<br /> Beat in egg, then stir in molasses and water. Gradually stir the sifted ingredients into the molasses mixture until well combined. </li>
        <li>Use floured hands to shape dough into 24 walnut-sized balls. Roll each ball in the reserved sugar until coated.<br /> Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets, and flatten slightly with the bottom of a glass. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, switching racks halfway through.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
